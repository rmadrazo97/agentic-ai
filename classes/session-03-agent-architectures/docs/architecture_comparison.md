# Agent Architecture Comparison Guide 🏗️

Deep dive into the three major agent architectures with practical guidance.

## Quick Reference Table

| Architecture | Best For | Complexity | Cost | Use When |
|--------------|----------|------------|------|----------|
| **ReAct** | Simple tool chains | Low | 1x | Single-step or linear tasks |
| **Plan-Act-Reflect** | Multi-step workflows | Medium | 2-3x | Complex tasks with branching |
| **Auto-GPT Loop** | Open-ended exploration | High | 5-10x | Research, autonomous agents |

## 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) 🎭

### Architecture
```
User Query → LLM → Tool → LLM → Tool → ... → Final Answer
```

### How It Works
1. **Think**: LLM reasons about what to do next
2. **Act**: LLM calls an appropriate tool
3. **Observe**: LLM sees the tool's result
4. **Repeat**: Continue until goal achieved

### Example Trace
```
Human: What's the square root of Berlin's population?

Thought: I need to find Berlin's population first
Action: web_search
Action Input: Berlin population 2024
Observation: Berlin has approximately 3.7 million residents

Thought: Now I need to calculate the square root of 3,700,000
Action: calculator
Action Input: sqrt(3700000)
Observation: √3700000.0 = 1924.50

Thought: I now have the final answer
Final Answer: The square root of Berlin's population is approximately 1,924
```

### Pros ✅
- **Simple to implement** - Single LLM, clear prompt
- **Cost effective** - Only one LLM call per step
- **Fast iteration** - No planning overhead
- **Transparent** - Easy to debug thinking process

### Cons ❌
- **Can get stuck** - May loop between same tools
- **No global planning** - Doesn't see the big picture
- **Limited for complex tasks** - Struggles with multi-step workflows
- **Reactive** - No proactive strategy

### Best Use Cases
- ✅ Q&A with fact lookup + calculation
- ✅ Simple API integrations
- ✅ Linear workflows (step 1 → step 2 → done)
- ✅ Real-time chat applications

### Implementation Tips
```python
# Keep tool descriptions concise
Tool(name="search", description="Search web for current facts")

# Use clear action formats
Action: search
Action Input: specific query here

# Add stopping conditions
max_iterations=10  # Prevent infinite loops
```

## 2. Plan-Act-Reflect 📋⚡🎯

### Architecture
```
Goal → Planner → [Step1, Step2, Step3] → Executor → Results → Critic
   ↖                                                           ↙
     Critic evaluates, may trigger replanning
```

### How It Works
1. **Plan**: Create detailed step-by-step strategy
2. **Act**: Execute each step systematically
3. **Reflect**: Evaluate results and identify errors
4. **Revise**: Update plan if needed and retry

### Example Trace
```
Human: Calculate average population of top 3 European cities

PLANNER:
Plan: [
  "Search for list of largest European cities by population",
  "Extract population numbers for top 3 cities", 
  "Calculate the average of these three numbers"
]

EXECUTOR:
Step 1: web_search("largest European cities by population")
Result: Istanbul (15M), Moscow (12M), London (9M)...

Step 2: Extract numbers: Istanbul=15M, Moscow=12M, London=9M
Result: [15000000, 12000000, 9000000]

Step 3: calculator("(15000000 + 12000000 + 9000000) / 3")
Result: Average = 12,000,000

CRITIC:
✅ Goal achieved: Found top 3 cities and calculated average
Confidence: 95%
```

### Pros ✅
- **Global visibility** - Can see entire plan upfront
- **Error correction** - Reflection catches mistakes
- **Systematic** - Methodical approach to complex tasks
- **Explainable** - Clear reasoning at each stage

### Cons ❌
- **Higher cost** - 2-3x more LLM calls (plan + execute + reflect)
- **Complexity** - More moving parts to implement
- **Over-planning** - May create unnecessarily detailed plans
- **Slower** - Additional overhead for simple tasks

### Best Use Cases
- ✅ Multi-step research projects
- ✅ Data analysis workflows
- ✅ Content creation pipelines
- ✅ Tasks requiring quality assurance

### Implementation Tips
```python
# Use structured planning prompts
"Break this goal into 3-5 specific, actionable steps..."

# Implement reflection with clear criteria
"Evaluate: 1) Goal achieved? 2) What's missing? 3) Confidence level?"

# Set iteration limits
max_plan_revisions = 2  # Prevent endless replanning
```

## 3. Auto-GPT Style Loop 🤖🔄

### Architecture
```
Goal → Memory → Generate Task → Execute → Update Memory → Assess Goal
  ↖                                                              ↙
   Loop continues until goal achieved or limits reached
```

### How It Works
1. **Assess**: Evaluate current progress toward goal
2. **Generate**: Create next most important task
3. **Execute**: Carry out the task with tools
4. **Learn**: Store results in persistent memory
5. **Repeat**: Continue until goal achieved

### Example Trace
```
Human: Research latest AI agent trends and create summary

ITERATION 1:
Goal Assessment: 0% complete, need to gather information
Generated Task: Search for recent AI agent research papers
Execution: web_search("AI agents 2024 research trends")
Memory: Stored findings about LLM agents, multimodal, etc.

ITERATION 2:
Goal Assessment: 25% complete, have some trends but need more depth
Generated Task: Search for commercial AI agent applications
Execution: web_search("commercial AI agents companies 2024")
Memory: Added info about AutoGPT, ChatGPT plugins, etc.

ITERATION 3:
Goal Assessment: 60% complete, need to synthesize findings
Generated Task: Organize findings into trend categories
Execution: calculator("organize data into themes")
Memory: Created structured summary

ITERATION 4:
Goal Assessment: 90% complete, ready to finalize
Generated Task: Create final summary report
Execution: Format final summary with key trends
Result: ✅ Goal achieved!
```

### Pros ✅
- **Fully autonomous** - Can work independently for hours
- **Adaptive** - Changes strategy based on what it learns
- **Persistent memory** - Builds knowledge over time
- **Handles complexity** - Can tackle open-ended goals

### Cons ❌
- **Expensive** - 5-10x cost due to repeated LLM calls
- **Unpredictable** - May pursue irrelevant tangents
- **Risk of loops** - Can get stuck repeating similar tasks
- **Needs guardrails** - Requires careful safety limits

### Best Use Cases
- ✅ Research and information gathering
- ✅ Content creation workflows
- ✅ Exploratory data analysis
- ✅ Personal assistant tasks

### Implementation Tips
```python
# Essential safety limits
max_iterations = 10
cost_limit = 0.50  # Dollar limit
timeout = 300      # 5 minute limit

# Memory management
def prune_memory():
    if len(memory) > 100:
        memory = memory[-50:]  # Keep recent 50 items

# Cost tracking
estimated_cost += estimate_tokens(prompt) * cost_per_token
if estimated_cost > cost_limit:
    break
```

## Hybrid Approaches 🔀

### ReAct + Planning
```python
# Use planning for complex tasks, ReAct for execution
if is_complex_task(query):
    plan = create_plan(query)
    for step in plan:
        result = react_agent.execute(step)
else:
    result = react_agent.execute(query)
```

### Plan-Act-Reflect + Auto-GPT
```python
# Use PAR for structured parts, Auto-GPT for exploration
if task_type == "structured":
    return plan_act_reflect_agent.run(task)
elif task_type == "exploratory":
    return autogpt_agent.run(task)
```

### Cascading Architecture
```python
# Try simple first, escalate to complex if needed
try:
    result = react_agent.run(query)
    if quality_score(result) < threshold:
        result = plan_act_reflect_agent.run(query)
except Exception:
    result = autogpt_agent.run(query)
```

## Production Considerations ⚙️

### Monitoring & Observability
```python
# Track key metrics for each architecture
metrics = {
    "react": {"avg_cost": 0.01, "success_rate": 0.85, "avg_time": 5},
    "par": {"avg_cost": 0.03, "success_rate": 0.92, "avg_time": 15},
    "autogpt": {"avg_cost": 0.15, "success_rate": 0.78, "avg_time": 60}
}
```

### Error Handling
- **ReAct**: Retry with rephrased prompt
- **Plan-Act-Reflect**: Revise plan based on errors
- **Auto-GPT**: Human-in-the-loop checkpoints

### Scaling Considerations
- **ReAct**: Easily parallelizable
- **Plan-Act-Reflect**: Pipeline stages can be distributed
- **Auto-GPT**: Resource-intensive, needs queuing

**Remember**: Start simple with ReAct, then upgrade based on actual requirements. Don't over-engineer from the beginning!
