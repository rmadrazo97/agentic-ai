# Agentic AI Course

**Building Production-Ready AI Agents: A Startup Simulation**

> 34 sessions · 1h 20min each · 17 weeks · Multi-provider hands-on experience

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course teaches students to build production-ready AI agents through a startup simulation format. Students work in teams of 3-4 to develop real-world agent applications while gaining hands-on experience with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, X AI) and modern agent architectures.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Startup Simulation Format**: Learn by building a real product from concept to deployment
- **Multi-Provider Experience**: Work with OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, X AI Grok
- **Production Tools**: LangChain, AutoGen, FastAPI, Vector DBs, Docker, GitHub
- **Industry Best Practices**: CI/CD, testing, monitoring, cost optimization, ethics

| Micro-Lecture | 15-20 min | Essential theory, patterns, case studies, live demos |
| Guided Lab / Build Time | 45-50 min | Instructor-led coding followed by team hacking |
| Wrap-up / Retro | 5 min | Key takeaways, next sprint tasks, references |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Development**: GitHub Classroom, Docker, VS Code
- **Agent Frameworks**: LangChain, AutoGen
- **APIs & SDKs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI, X AI Grok, Replicate
- **Vector Databases**: Chroma, Pinecone

- Multi-provider integration

### Phase 2: Advanced Patterns (Weeks 5-8)
- Autonomous task loops and memory strategies
- Function calling and tool design
- Planning and decomposition
- Evaluation and safety guardrails
- **Mid-Semester Demo Day**

### Phase 3: Production Systems (Weeks 9-12)
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Voice and multimodal agents
- Action agents and autonomous UIs
- Cost optimization and scaling

### Phase 4: Deployment & Demo (Weeks 13-17)
- Human-in-the-loop patterns
- Ethics and privacy considerations
- Domain-specific implementations
- Load testing and chaos engineering
- **Final Demo Day with External Panel**

## 📊 Assessment Matrix

| Component | Weight | What We Look For | Evidence / Artifacts |
|-----------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Sprint Participation | 15% | Quality of stand-up updates, responsiveness to blockers, peer collaboration, and equitable Git activity | Stand-up comments, commit log per sprint, peer feedback pulses |
| Lab Checkpoints | 30% | Technical correctness, passing CI tests, documentation, and incremental progress across the 12 guided labs | Pull-requests merged at the end of each sprint with auto-grade report |
| Mid-Semester Demo (Week 8) | 20% | Clarity of problem/solution, live agent functionality, and ability to answer technical Q&A from classmates & instructor | Five-minute demo video, README, and peer-review rubric (averaged) |
| Final Demo Day (Week 17) | 35% | Product completeness, innovation, real-world viability, robustness under panel questioning, and live performance of the agent | External jury scoring sheet (70%), instructor rubric (30%); includes code freeze tag and deployment URL |

**Total: 100%**

*Note: Ethics, safety, and reflection requirements are embedded into both Demo rubrics (10% of each demo's score). This keeps ethical considerations front-and-center while simplifying the grade ledger.*

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:

1. **Design and implement** production-ready AI agents using multiple LLM providers
2. **Master** core agent patterns: ReAct, planning, tool use, memory, evaluation
3. **Build** complete agent applications with proper testing, monitoring, and deployment
4. **Understand** ethical considerations, safety measures, and cost optimization
5. **Experience** real startup development through team-based product building

## 🏆 Final Project

Teams develop a domain-specific agent application (education, finance, dev-ops, healthcare) from concept to deployment, culminating in a VC-style pitch to an external panel of industry professionals.
